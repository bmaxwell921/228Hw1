Manual Checks (50 points)
==============================			
	Style 														(6 total points)
		- Javadoc 							(3 points)
		- @author Tags 						(2 points)
		- Variable names 					(1 point)
	Directory Structure 										(4 total points)
		- Zip file with correct structure,
		and proper package names
	Simulator 													(40 total points)
	(Use the configuration files found in SimulationConigurations. Invalid configurations should just 
	not crash, hopefully they have some output, but the specs don't say they need any. Valid files
	just need to run, the automated tests already evaluate whether the actual classes work so no
	need to check the output.) 													
		- Not enough keywords 				(8 points)
			(NotEnoughKeywords.txt)
		- Not enough values for a keyword 	(8 points)
			(NotEnoughValuesForKeyword.txt)
		- Invalid values  					(8 points)
			(InvalidValue.txt)
		- Normal order 						(8 points)
			(ValidInOrder.txt)
		- Out of order 						(8 points)
			(ValidOutOfOrder.txt)

Junit Tests (20 points)
==============================
NOTE: This is the mostly subjective. Typically what we look 
for is: did they actually make an attempt to write tests 
properly. I.e. there are a 'decent' amount of tests - at least 
one per method of the testing class. Feel free to leave comments 
about the style of their testing so they can get better.
